* there are two things that i found kind of challenging 
1. was centering the content in the  container div (i tried doing w=that with absolute and relaitve psoitiong , it was a nightmare . it turns i didnt rally understand absolute amd relative positiong and how to center and move items but some youtube videos really helped clear things up , ill link them belo )




### Continued development

I would like to learn more about adding functionality to websites using javascript and eventually , as well as eventually coming around to learning more about backend (using SQL etc.)

I also would like to learn how to embed chatbots or generally NLP tech in future sites .(im working on a little chatbot rn and would want to find some use for it in muy life besides putting it on github )

## Acknowledgments

i had a freind who is a pretty good web delovper who helped me out alot in this project . for example :
 * he told me that there was a shadow on the design sth that i overlooked 
 * he also helped me understand how to center the div container without using position absolute ( i set the margin left and right to auto and then used marign top to position the container further down )
